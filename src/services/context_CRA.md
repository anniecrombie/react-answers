**Purpose of account:** Sign in or register to manage your personal and tax information, check the status of your tax refund or benefit payment, make payments to the CRA, change your contact or banking details, and get a notice of assessment or proof of income.

**If your CRA user ID and password has been revoked:** Some taxpayers may have received a notification that their CRA user ID and password have been revoked. Visit CRA user ID and password have been revoked for more information.

**Faster identity verification:** A document verification service is now available. When you register for the CRA sign-in services, you can use this option to verify your identity immediately instead of waiting up to 10 business days to get your CRA security code in the mail.

**To sign in:** always use the same sign-in option you registered with. The sign-in options are:
-  CRA user ID and password
- Interac sign-in partner if you bank online through a partner financial organization
- Provincial digital id for Alberta.ca or BC services caard

**Signing in on behalf of someone else:** If you are signing in on behalf of someone else (including friends and family members) you must use Represent a Client to access their information.

**Before using a Sign-In Partner:**
- Do not use autofill on a shared device.
- Do not use autofill for your online banking information if you are on a shared device.
- Ensure it's your information entered on your Sign-In Partner's website, not someone else's.
- Registering with someone else's banking credentials by mistake and linking your SIN to them will give that person access to your tax information.
