**Purpose of account:** Sign in or register to manage your personal and tax information, check the status of your tax refund or benefit payment, make payments to the CRA, change your contact or banking details, and get a notice of assessment or proof of income.

**If your CRA user ID and password has been revoked:** Some taxpayers may have received a notification that their CRA user ID and password have been revoked. Visit CRA user ID and password have been revoked for more information.

**Faster identity verification:** A document verification service is now available. When you register for the CRA sign-in services, you can use this option to verify your identity immediately instead of waiting up to 10 business days to get your CRA security code in the mail.

**To sign in:** always use the same sign-in option you registered with. The sign-in options are:
- CRA user ID and password
- Interac sign-in partner
- Provincial digital id for Alberta.ca or BC services caard

**Signing in on behalf of someone else:** If you are signing in on behalf of someone else (including friends and family members) you must use Represent a Client to access their information.

**Before using a Sign-In Partner:**
- Do not use autofill on a shared device.
- Do not use autofill for your online banking information if you are on a shared device.
- Ensure it's your information entered on your Sign-In Partner's website, not someone else's.
- Registering with someone else's banking credentials by mistake and linking your SIN to them will give that person access to your tax information.

# Register for the CRA sign-in services

Follow the steps below to register for My Account for individuals.

## Decide if you need to register

If you have already registered for the CRA sign-in services using a CRA user ID and password or a Sign-In Partner, you cannot register again. You must use the same sign-in information to access the following:

- My Account
- My Business Account
- Represent a Client

### Already registered

#### Use your existing credentials:

If you have already registered for the CRA sign-in services, sign in with your existing credentials.

If you registered with a provincial partner, you must also create a CRA user ID and password or use a Sign-In Partner to access:

- My Business Account
- Represent a Client

If you have forgotten your CRA user ID or password, go to: Lost or forgotten CRA user ID or password.

#### Change the option you sign in with:

- If you registered with a provincial partner, you can also create a CRA user ID and password or use a Sign-In Partner.
- If you registered with a CRA user ID and password, you can sign in with your CRA user ID and password and revoke your credential so you can register with a different sign-in option or create a new CRA user ID and password.
- If you registered with a Sign-In Partner, you can sign in to your current Sign-In Partner and switch to a different Sign-In Partner.

### Signing in to another service for the first time

#### My Business Account:

If you are signing in to My Business Account for the first time, you will be asked for your 9-digit business number.

#### Represent a Client:

If you are signing in to Represent a Client for the first time, you will have to register yourself or your business as a representative.

You will also have to request authorization to access someone else's tax information.

## Gather your documents

When you register with a CRA user ID and password or a Sign-In Partner, you will need all of the following:

1. Your social insurance number (SIN)

   If you do not have a SIN:
   If you don't have a SIN, we will also accept:
   - A temporary tax number (TTN)
   - An individual tax number (ITN)

2. Your date of birth

3. Amounts you reported on your most recent tax return

   Which tax return you can use:
   The income tax and benefit return you use must meet both of the following conditions:
   - It was filed and assessed
   - It is from either the current or previous tax year

   Use only the amounts that you reported on your return, even if your return was reassessed and the amounts have changed.

For faster access to the CRA sign-in services, you will also need a mobile device with a working camera and one of the following:

- Your Canadian passport
- Your Canadian driver's license
- Your provincial or territorial photo ID card

When you register with a provincial partner, you only need your SIN.

Have your documents ready before you begin:
During registration, your session will expire after 18 minutes of inactivity. Gather your documents before you begin to avoid your session timing out.

## Choose a sign-in option to register with

The option you register with will be the same option you use each time you sign in. Make a selection below to begin.

### Find the best option for your situation

Learn more about the sign-in options:

#### Interac Sign-In Partner:

This option lets you use the same banking sign-in information you use with other online financial accounts. You must already have an online account with one of our Sign-In Partners.

#### CRA user ID and password:

This option lets you create a username and password that you use with the CRA sign-in services.

#### Provincial digital ID for BC or Alberta:

If you already have a BC Services Card or an Alberta.ca Account, you can use them to immediately access your My Account.

Provincial partner:
- The first time you sign in, you will need to enter your SIN to verify your identity. You will not need to use the document verification service or a CRA security code to verify your identity.
- You can register with your provincial partner even if you have not filed your taxes in the last 2 years, as long as you have filed your taxes at least once in the past.
- You cannot use your provincial partner to access My Business Account, Represent a Client, and certain services like Auto-fill My Return. If you would like to access those services, you can still create a CRA user ID and password or use a Sign-In Partner.

#### GC Key:

You cannot use GC Key to sign in to the CRA sign-in services.
You can use GC Key with other Government of Canada departments and agencies.

Your sign-in information is anonymous:
The Government of Canada uses anonymous credentials to allow users to communicate securely with online Government of Canada services. An anonymous credential is one that does not contain any personally identifiable information.

### Help with Sign-In Partners

Learn more about our commitment to your privacy: Privacy Statement

#### More help with Sign-In Partners

Do not use autofill on a shared device:
Do not use autofill for your online banking information if you are on a shared device. When you are on your Sign-In Partner's website, ensure it is your information that is entered and not that of somebody else.

If you register with someone else's banking credentials by mistake and link your SIN to them, the other person will have access to your tax information.

### Help with CRA User ID and password

### Help with provincial partners

## Verify your identity

Choose an option to verify your identity:

### Option 1: Submit a photo of yourself and your ID document

You can use the document verification service to verify your identity immediately.

Use a mobile device to take a real-time picture of yourself and an accepted identification document.

You must be 16 years of age or older to use this service.

### Option 2: Wait for your CRA security code

If you can't use the document verification service, a CRA security code will be sent to you by mail within 10 business days.

We will send your CRA security code to the address we have on file. Make sure your address is up to date.

You will need to select the same sign-in option you registered for and enter your CRA security code before it expires.

## Get limited access before completing your identity verification

### Enroll in multi-factor authentication (MFA)

You will be required to enter a one-time passcode in addition to your password to sign in.

Choose an option to get your one-time passcode:

1. By phone:
   You will need to provide at least one cell or landline number so we can send you a one-time passcode by phone. You must enter this number to access your CRA sign-in service.

2. With a passcode grid:
   The system will generate a unique passcode grid that you will need to save or print. You will use this grid every time you access your CRA sign-in service.

   Your passcode grid will expire after 18 months. Make sure you sign in and generate a new one before the expiry date.

3. With an authenticator app:
   You can use a third-party authenticator app to generate your time-based one-time passcode.

   When prompted, use the app downloaded on your mobile or desktop device to either scan a QR code or manually enter the setup key provided by the CRA. The app can then be used to generate your one-time passcode.

Avoid getting locked out of your account:

Enroll in multiple multi-factor authentication (MFA) options:
We recommend that you enroll in more than one option, although only one option is required. Enrolling in multiple MFA options will help ensure that you can still access the CRA sign-in services if you change your phone number, misplace your passcode grid, or delete the third-party authenticator app.

If your account becomes locked:
If your account becomes locked due to entering the wrong passcode too many times, you will be temporarily locked out for 30 minutes. After that period, you can try again. If this happens 3 times, you will be permanently locked out, and will need to contact us.

## Complete your identity verification

Complete the verification option that you chose in step 4:

### Option 1: The document verification service

Follow the instructions to complete this process on your mobile device.

Avoid losing your progress:
During registration, your session will expire after 18 minutes of inactivity. Complete your document verification within that time to avoid your session timing out.

### Option 2: CRA security code

After you receive your CRA security code in the mail, sign in to My Account and enter your code before it expires.

Get a new CRA security code:
If your CRA security code expired, sign in to request a new CRA security code to be sent by mail.

If your code gets lost, or has not arrived after 10 business days, you can contact us to get a new one.
