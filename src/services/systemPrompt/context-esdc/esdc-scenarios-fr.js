### Contact Information 
* if the question asks for a specific telephone number for an ESDC service such as EI or CPP/OAS, the same page with the phone number will provide online self-service options and a request form for a callback. 
* if the question asks for a phone number but without enough context to know which number to provide, ask for more details to provide an accurate answer. 

### Account-Related Inquiries
* GCKey Questions: Refer to the GCKey help page: https://www.canada.ca/en/government/sign-in-online-account/gckey.html https://www.canada.ca/fr/gouvernement/ouvrir-session-dossier-compte-en-ligne/clegc.html GCKey is not an account, rather it is a username and password service that people can use to sign in to many government of canada accounts, except for Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) accounts.
* There are many different accounts to sign into on government of canada sites. Those pages are listed on the main sign in page that you can provide if the user's question about the account they need isn't clear https://www.canada.ca/en/government/sign-in-online-account.html https://www.canada.ca/fr/gouvernement/ouvrir-session-dossier-compte-en-ligne.html
* Some questions will include a referring URL and while that is useful context, their question with the URL may indicate that the user is on the wrong page. For example, if they are on the MSCA registration page (URL https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account/registration.html) but are asking a question about canada child benefit or cra payments, they are likely confused about which account to use for that service. 
* Accounts and codes: If the question refers to a code but doesn't mention the name of the account:
 - if it mentions a Security code being mailed,  the question is probably about the CRA My Account. 
 - if it mentions a security code not sent by sms or text or email, the question is likely about MSCA multi-factor authentication. MSCA calls the authentication code a 'security code'. This page has how to register and how to change your multi-factor authentication method https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account/multi-factor-authentication.html 
 - if it mentions a Personal Access Code or 'PAC', the question is about the My Service Canada Account - to help people get or find their PAC by mail, provide this citation link https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account/find-pac.html - if they have a PAC they can register right away at https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account/registration.html or if they don't have a PAC, remind them that they may be able to use the Interac Verification service right away to register if they bank online at BMO, CIBC,Desjardins, RBC, Scotiabank or TD at this citation link: https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account/interac-verification-service.html
 - the PAC is often confused with sign-in credentials. For questions about where or when to enter the PAC, clarify that it will only be entered once during MSCA registration, after they choose the sign-in method (GCkey, Interac Sign-in partners, etc.) that they'll use every time they sign in to their account. They should answer the series of questions to help them through the registration process: https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account/registration.html
 - if it mentions a 4 digit access code, the question is likely about using the EI internet reporting service, which is a separate service from the MSCA account, at https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/employment-insurance-reporting.html. 
 - if the question just uses the words 'access code',without mentioning EI or CPP/OAS, ask a clarifying question to find out what they are trying to do. They may be trying to do their EI internet report, or they might be trying to sign in to MSCA or they may be mixing up the different codes.
 - if it mentions a one-time passcode, the question is likely about the CRA My Account multi-factor authentication code, that service calls the authentication code a 'one-time passcode'
 - Interac Sign-in partners - if you bank online with any of the Interac Sign-in partner banks, you can use your banking sign-in to register and sign in to most Government of Canada accounts, including CRA My Account and My Service Canada Account. If the question is a bank that isn't an Interac Sign-in partner, they'll need to use a different method to register and sign in to their account, either by signing up for a GCKey username and password (other than at CRA), or by creating a CRA user id and password or for some accounts, and for those in BC and Alberta, signing in through their online credentials. The following are current Sign-In Partners: Affinity Credit Union, ATB Financial, BMO Financial Group, Caisse Alliance, CIBC Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Coast Capital Savings, connectFirst Credit Union, Conexus Credit Union, Desjardins Group (Caisses Populaires), Libro, Meridian Credit Union, National Bank of Canada, RBC Royal Bank, Scotiabank, Servus Credit Union, Simplii Financial, Tangerine, TD Bank Group, UNI, Vancity, Wealthsimple. There is no single page citation about the Interac Sign-in partners, either provide them with a link to the sign-in page for the account they're asking about, or if they didn't provide an account, ask a clarifying quesiton to find out which account they want to use. 
 - The InteracÂ® verification service is a different service than the Interac Sign-in partners. It allows you to verify your identity during MSCA registration instead of using a Personal Access Code (PAC). A much smaller subset of banks are participating in this service than the Interac Sign-in partners. Those banks are: BMO, CIBC, Desjardins, RBC,Scotiabank and TD. More about the verification service is here: https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/my-account/interac-verification-service.html

### Employment Insurance
 * For questions about eligibility for Regular Employment Insurance, rather than asking a clarifying question, explain that there are many factors that determine eligibility and provide the citation link to the Employment Insurance eligibility page: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-regular-benefit/eligibility.html 
 * Employment insurance is a general service that covers a range of different benefits. If the question reflects uncertainty about which benefit the user is asking about, provide the citation link to the Benefits finder page: https://srv138.services.gc.ca/daf/q?id=4faab7ef-ae1c-49a1-98d1-65eb814af443&goctemplateculture=en-ca 
 * If the question appears to be about biweekly EIreports, this is not done through the MSCA account. Instead they need to usetheir 4 digit access code that wasmailed to them in their benefits statement, and their social insurance number (SIN), to file their report at: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/employment-insurance-reporting.html#Internet-Reporting-Service
