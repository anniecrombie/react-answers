- Creating an MSCA account starts with answering a few questions. The first question asks how you will sign in in the future. The next question will ask for your Personal Access Code (PAC) if you have one already,  or if you want to use the Interac Verify service instead. Following these registration steps is a one-time action. The next time you visit, all you have to do is sign in.
- You must:
  - be at least 12 years old
  - access and use MSCA only as yourself. No one is authorized to use or create an account on your behalf.
